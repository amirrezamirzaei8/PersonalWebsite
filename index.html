                    <h3>LLM Gateway Automation</h3>
                    <p>I developed and deployed an Azure Function App using Python to automate the processing of over 500 ISP maintenance emails monthly for Nokia, significantly reducing manual effort by 80%. To streamline data extraction and formatting, I designed an Azure Logic App that parses email content, converts it to JSON, and triggers HTTP POST requests to the Function App, ensuring 100% accuracy. By integrating Nokia’s LLM Gateway with OpenAI’s library, I extracted actionable insights from maintenance emails, improving processing speed by 80% and enhancing decision-making. This solution leverages a modern tech stack, including Python, httpx, Microsoft Azure, and OpenAI, demonstrating my expertise in cloud automation, API integration, and AI-driven processing. It not only enhances operational efficiency but also showcases the power of AI in optimizing enterprise workflows.</p>

                    <h3>Fortigate Firewall Automation</h3>
                    <p>Designed and implemented a modular Ansible playbook to automate complex FortiGate firewall configurations, enhancing scalability and efficiency in managing network security for over 100 network devices. Leveraged Jinja2 templating to dynamically generate reusable configuration files for address groups, custom services, and service groups, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency. Integrated Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve FortiGate access tokens during playbook execution, ensuring robust credential protection and compliance with security standards. Deployed the playbook through Semaphore CI/CD pipelines, streamlining continuous integration workflows and reducing manual effort by 40%. This initiative cut configuration time by 50% and significantly improved the reliability and security of firewall management processes, supporting 500+ users at Nokia.</p>

                    <h3>DDI Service Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Implemented a comprehensive real-time monitoring solution for DDI services using Grafana and Prometheus, enhancing visibility into performance metrics across DNS and system services. Created and configured an Ubuntu virtual machine to host the monitoring stack, where Grafana, Prometheus, and Bind Exporter were deployed, enabling collection and visualization of over 50 DNS and system-related metrics. On the FreeBSD server, compiled and installed a FreeBSD-compatible version of Node Exporter using Go, ensuring compatibility with the server’s architecture and enabling system monitoring. Designed and optimized 10+ Grafana dashboards, providing actionable insights that empowered teams to identify and resolve network issues faster. Configured Prometheus alerting mechanisms for over 15 critical system thresholds, enabling rapid incident response and reducing downtime by 30%. This initiative revolutionized DDI service monitoring at Nokia, improving operational efficiency and fostering data-driven decision-making.</p>
